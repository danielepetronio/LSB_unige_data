# LSB_unige_data
This folder provides data of laminar separation bubbles reported in the paper "An Experimental Database for Machine Learning of Algebraic Models in Separated Flows". Data have been organized in 7-columns files, named by flow conditions in terms of Reynolds number (ReL), acceleration parameter (AP) and freestream turbulent intensity (Tu). The 7 columns are in order: the spatial coordinates x and y (m), the time-mean flow components U and V (m/s) and the streamwise, wall-normal and shear stress components u′2, v′2 and u′v′ (m2/s2). Data are stacked by wallnormal profiles. The wall-normal coordinate y can be subjected to a variation of ±(Δy/2) ≈ ±0.2(mm) due to uncertainty in the definition of the wall position due to PIV reflections.
